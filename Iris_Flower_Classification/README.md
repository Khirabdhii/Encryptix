## Problem Statement

The iris flower, scientifically known as Iris, is a distinctive genus of flowering plants. Within this genus, there are three primary species: **Iris setosa**, **Iris versicolor**, and **Iris virginica**. These species exhibit variations in their physical characteristics, particularly in the measurements of their **sepal length**, **sepal width**, **petal length**, and **petal width**.

**Objective:**

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of learning from the measurements of iris flowers and accurately classifying them into their respective species. The model's primary goal is to automate the classification process based on the distinct characteristics of each iris species.

## Project Summary
The important steps of the project can summarized as follows:

1.  **Data Exploration**: Through a thorough examination of the dataset, we gained insights into the characteristics and distributions of features. We found that Iris-Setosa exhibited distinct features compared to the other two species. We also found that Iris Virginica is the longest flower and Iris Setosa is the shortest.
    
2.  **Data Preprocessing**: Data preprocessing steps, including handling missing and duplicated values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, were performed to prepare the dataset for modeling.
    
3.  **Model Training and Evaluation**: Various classification models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-NN, Naive Bayes and SVM  were trained on the training dataset and evaluated using appropriate metrics such as recall, accuracy, F1-score and precision.

4. **Model Selection**: After experimenting with various machine learning models, K-NN was chosen as the final model due to its simplicity, interpretability, and good performance in classifying Iris species.
    
## Conclusion
In conclusion, the Iris flower classification project successfully employed **K-NN** as the final prediction model to classify Iris species. It obtained a **recall** of **97%**  which is our primary evaluation metric for this project. The project's outcomes have practical implications in the field of botany and offer valuable insights into feature importance for species differentiation. Further refinements and enhancements may lead to even more accurate and reliable classification models in the future.
